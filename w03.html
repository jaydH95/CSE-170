                <H4>1- What did you do to prepare for class this week?</H4>
                <P>This week, I reviewed the assigned readings twice. The first time, I took notes, and the second time was at the beginning of class as a refresh.</P>
                <H4>2- What concepts from this week are you uncertain of and would like to know more about?</H4>
                <P>I think it was really fun going over the personality types and how they can influence our actions in the workspace. I think it would be interesting to learn more about how these personality types interact with each other most effectively, both to the benefit of the company, and the team members. </P>
                <H4>3- Where did you put your assignments in Github?</H4>
                <P>This week's reflection is located in my CSE-170 repository under the folder “index.html” and titled "w03".</P>
                <H4>Why is this week's topic important?</H4>
                <P>This week's topic is important because it allows us to better understand our own personality and become self aware as to how we will respond in certain circumstances. Knowing this will give us the ability to better organize our goals and desired outcomes in a way we are more likely to achieve them. </P>
                <H3>10 Points</H3>
                <H4>5- What is the most significant take away you have gained from your study this week?</H4>
                <P>For me, the most important takeaway was the varying definitions of personality types. For example, introversion can mean several differnet things depending on the context of the scenario. By understanding the arbitrary qualities of personality and how they are affected by environment, we can better predict the outcomes of these interactions.</P>
                <H4>6- What would you do differently next week?</H4>
                <P>This week, I was a little disorganized both in my studies and dorm life. I am going to work on creating an operating schedule where I can implement the study habits I've been working on.</P>
                <H3>20 Points</H3>
                <H4>7- Why is this week's topic important for teamwork?</H4>
                <P>This week's lesson was critical to understanding the contrasting personality types of everyone involved in the team. So this was a really good opportunity to learn more about them and their strengths.</P>
                <H4>8- How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?</H4>
                <P>Maybe I should make my team snacks. I had a question about some of the studies done in the personality assessments, and one of my team members found me a source pertaining to my question, which was a little out of the way for them. I'm super grateful and want to return that same energy when I see the opportunity. </P>
                <H4>9- How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had?</H4>
                <P>I've been on teams before where we've been assigned roles within the team and then had to collaborate on the project without really getting to know or understand each other's goals. So while being on a team together is not a new experience, I like this other dimension of being able to relate to someone outside of the team and then use the relations to enhance the way we can work together.</P>
                <H2>Total: 100 Points</H2>
