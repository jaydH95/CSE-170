        <h1>Week 12 Reflection</h1>
        <h2>Jayd Hill, CSE 170</h2>

        <h3>5 Points</h3>
        <h4>1- What did you do to prepare for class?</h4>
        <p>This week, I read the materials and scheduled times to meet up with my team.</p>

        <h4>2- What topics were studied this week and what are their definitions?</h4>
        <p>This week's topic is loyalty. It is defined by the combination of moral, motivation, and goals of the company. Motivation is used to drive good work ethic and committment to the company.</p>

        <h4>3- What phase of your projects did you complete?</h4>
        <p>We finished the rest of our projects this week and are wrapping up our final presentation.</p>

        <h4>4- Where did you put your assignments in Github?</h4>
        <p>My assignments are located in my CSE-170 repository.</p>

        <h3>10 Points</h3>
        <h4>5- What do you do, steps or processes related to this week's topic?</h4>
        <p>This week's topic is done in processes. Loyalty is not acquired in steps, but built over time as recognition and acceptance is exchanged. </p>

        <h4>6- What is the most significant takeaway you have gained from your study this week?</h4>
        <p>There were lots of good takeaways this week, but I think the most important one was the difference in work values between the older generations, who I will most likely be working for, and my generation. Hopefully as I come to understand the people I work with, I can leverage this understanding to communicate with better effectiveness. </p>

        <h3>20 Points</h3>
        <h4>7- How does your experience relate to other experiences you've had?</h4>
        <p>I took care of my grandmother for a few years, and the most difficult part of the experience was the vast difference in our mindsets concerning work and company loyalty. She always thought that I was making more money or recieving better recognition for the things that I was doing, and I thought she was crazy for not understanding the modern work environment. We had a lot of conversations about our experiences and while I'm not sure if we'll ever see eye to eye, I did learn a lot living with her.</p>

        <h4>8- How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?</h4>
        <p>I plan to offer support and moral encouragement to the team as we finish the end of the semester.</p>

        <h4>9- If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the Gospel?</h4>
        <p>Loyalty is a major driving force between where we place our efforts, and the biggest factor of it is love. As we build our loyalty through our actions, we can better love and exemplify Christ.</p>
