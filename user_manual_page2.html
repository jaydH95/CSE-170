        <h1>User Guide: Chapter 2- Jayd Hill</h1>
        <h2>Definitions and Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <ul class ="bullet">
            <li>I think health has a pretty broad definition, but can best be defined as choosing the choices that best optimize our life, either in physical, mental, or emotional aspects.</li>
            <li>I think that my health meter would be about 3/4 of the way full. </li>
            <li>One problem that I'm having is that I don't make consistent choices that prioritize any sort of outcome, I just kind of handle things as they come without keeping a goal in mind. I think that I can best improve my health by creating goals more specific to what I want for myself.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Work</h3>
        <ul class ="bullet">
            <li>Work also can hold a unique definition. In our economy, not everyone has to work for their livlihood, but in my circumstances, I do, so I will be focusing on the context and efforts of having a 9 to 5.</li>
            <li>I think that my meter is once again 3/4 of the way full.</li>
            <li>I chose this amount because when I work, I am very consistent about the effort and skills that I apply. However, sometimes I cross the threshold of giving when I'm not able to, and work begins to take away from other areas of my life. However, given the fact that I can support myself and my university goals, I think I am ultimately succeeding, even if some adjustments should be made.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Play</h3>
        <ul class ="bullet">
            <li>I consider anything I enjoy doing to be play, even if I try to make money off of doing it. I have lots of background projects in the artistic and technical sphere that I like to spend time on. I have even turned my videogame hobby into a podcast.</li>
            <li>The glass is more than half full. Once again, I give myself a rating of 3/4.</li>
            <li>If there is one problem that I have created from this tendency to pursue and investigate all things that I find interesting, it's that I don't follow through with them completely. Even the things I enjoy should contribute to my character, so I want to be intentional about understanding them and implementing them to the best of my ability, whether that be my photography blog or integrated ARG. I just need to finish one of them. Luckily, I won't be running out of things to do anytime soon.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Love</h3>
        <ul class ="bullet">
            <li>I think love represents the foundations of all relationships, whether familial, with friends, or a significant other. </li>
            <li>Here, I am a 4/4. </li>
            <li>I have spent a lot of effort the last few years trying to contribute more to my relationships, by enhancing the way I communicate. There are always going to be hiccups here because we're human, but I feel confident in the close relationships I have formed. I want to try to focus on friendships now. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Work View</h2>
        <p class="define">At this point in my life, I have to work to support myself, which isn't always the case for everyone. Most often, work is something that we give to society to support others (through products or skills), and in turn, recieve support (financially). In its highest form, work is how we contribute to and find fulfillment in society, and it is my goal to find this career for me and to help other people reach what it is for them.</p>
        <h2>Life View</h2>
        <p class="define">Honestly, I am still struggling to find the meaning of life. I was raised in a religious family. Logically, I know that there is a purpose to living, learning, growing, and sharing what we have in others. But emotionally, I am still facing a disconnect. My goal is to address this so that I can connect my work to my highest capacity of living.</p>
