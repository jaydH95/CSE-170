        <h1>Week 07 Reflection</h1>
        <h2>Jayd Hill, CSE 170</h2>
        <h3>5 Points</h3>
        <h4>1- What did you do to prepare for class?</h4>
        <p>I tried to make my Memorial Day last a little longer and maybe I didn't read all of the materials right away... However, after the first class, I prepared a little better and fulfilled all of the readings.</p>

        <h4>2- What topics were studied this week and what are their definitions?</h4>
        <p>This week, we talked about how to say "no". Although this sounds very straightforward, from the context of professionalism, this is about being able to fulfill committments, and before that, choosing them correctly. Sometimes saying "I'll try" is a form of dishonesty, and we need to be more upfront with and defend our capabilities.</p>

        <h4>3- What phase of your projects did you complete?</h4>
        <p>At 7pm on a Thursday, none of the team projects have been completed yet. We are currently organizing a time to meet over MS Teams. So, I guess we're currently in the 'storming' stage.</p>

        <h4>4- Where did you put your assignments in Github?</h4>
        <p>My Reflection this week is located in my CSE-170 repository on Github, although my team proposal will be turned in on canvas when we eventually sort that out. </p>

        <h3>10 Points</h3>
        <h4>5- What do you do, steps or processes related to this week's topic?</h4>
        <p>This week's around schedules is definitely done in steps. A lot of where people fall short in this skill is by treating it like a process where they don't really build or adjust based off of the information they've collected along the way.</p>

        <h4>6- What would you do differently next week?</h4>
        <p>This week in our team building challenge, I was super excited to share a solution with the class before we even started working together on it. Did I deprive them of the opportunity to come up with their own solutions  because I was so eager to share my own? In this sense, teamwork is still a tricky concept for me because even though I got the right answer, I don't know if I did the right thing. Maybe I'll wait for people to sort their thoughts out a little longer before jumping in with my ideas.</p>

        <h4>7- What is the most significant takeaway you have gained from your study this week?</h4>
        <p>My takeaway is definitely the scheduling. Although I usually get my work done on time, I'm horrible at keeping schedules and routines (and at making estimates). However, Spolsky's article mentioned how we usually have the wrong approach by being too generic with schedules, and can hone them based off of previous experiences. I know that I will be able to be better organized if I can put more effort into this approach.</p>

        <h4>8- How would you explain this week's topic to a person not in this class?</h4>
        <p>This week, we learned the importance of estimates for projects, but more importantly, how misleading they can be, and how we're almonst always incorrect, because we don't know what we'll be running into as we create projects. Rather than making impossible promises to soothe impossible deadlines, it is far more valuable to be realistic about the situation and adapt to our knowledge of the situation as we work through it.</p>

        <h3>20 Points</h3>
        <h4>9- How does your experience relate to other experiences you've had?</h4>
        <p>I used to be team leader on my school's robotics team, and we were responsible for two varying projects with different goals. This was back in the middle school days where we weren't very thorough researchers, despite our knack for innovation. I wish that I had listened to their ideas more and worked with them on the level that they wanted to instead of pushing everyone to a project that I thought would contribute the most to our success. We didn't perform badly, but I felt that I ultimately took away from other opportunities.</p>

        <h4>10- How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?</h4>
        <p>Although I have a dozen ideas on how to form the project, I plan on listening to everyone thoroughly before making a decision. Everyone deserves to find the role they feel most confident in.</p>
