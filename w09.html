        <h1>Week 09 Reflection</h1>
        <h2>Jayd Hill, CSE 170</h2>

        <h3>5 Points</h3>
        <h4>1- What did you do to prepare for class?</h4>
        <p>I prepared this week by reading the class resources, as well as contacting my teammates to set up a time to meet on our Acorn Projects. We're still kind of working on that last part.</p>

        <h4>2- What topics were studied this week and what are their definitions?</h4>
        <p>We had a handful of topics this week. Among the most important were competition, as well as ethics. Competition is practiced when we strive to create better work by comparing ourselves and our learning with the people around us. Sometimes this can be toxic in nature if people are using competition to isolate and sabotage others. This goes hand in hand with ethics, which determines the proper mindset in which we exchange, create, and share information.</p>

        <h4>3- What phase of your projects did you complete?</h4>
        <p>Unfortunately, we are still in the scheduling and revision page for our project, but we are all determined and have good work ethic, so I believe we will be able to finish on time and with a great project. </p>

        <h4>4- Where did you put your assignments in Github?</h4>
        <p>My end of week reflection is located in my CSE 170 repository.</p>

        <h3>10 Points</h3>
        <h4>5- What do you do, steps or processes related to this week's topic?</h4>
        <p>I'd say that competition, especially competition that helps people grow, is done in a process. This can be exemplified by Astrid's story, when she adapted to the research environment of her group. By being open minded and sharing and solving with each other, they were able to write high quality code.</p>

        <h4>6- What is the most significant takeaway you have gained from your study this week?</h4>
        <p>The most significant takeaway for me is the Clean Coder book and ACM Book of Ethics. I feel like to succeed in an engineering field, I need as much applied practice as possible, so I was thrown for a little loop when I learned that there were books about coding principles and theory. I've fallen out of reading in the last couple of years, but I plan to start with these resources to jump back into the habit.</p>

        <h3>20 Points</h3>
        <h4>7- How does your experience relate to other experiences you've had?</h4>
        <p>I've been in situations which involve positive and negative aspects of competition. A good example of this was when I was learning to draw. A friend of my family was a very accomplished artist, and she was sharing her work. I thought that it was cool, so I went to draw... And my drawing was laughed at. I'm still not over the humiliation of that experience. But after that, I started drawing with friends who were still learning and interested in exploring their creativity. We built our skills together, and still do many projects together to this day.</p>

        <h4>8- How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?</h4>
        <p>Despite various edits to our project, our proposal was not approved. Because I don't have class on Fridays, it's my responsibility to meet with the Professor during office hours and get more informed feedback on the changes we need to make, and then report to my group.</p>

        <h4>9- If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the Gospel?</h4>
        <p>2nd Nephi chapter 2 is one of my favorite chapters to reflect on. It talks about the necessity of opposition in our existence, which I mentioned in the week we talked about conflict. I think that the same goes for competition; if we are not put in situations that emphasize the importance and necessity of ethics, we end up tearing each other down. However, competition is also what helps us compliment each other's work and fill in the gaps, and it makes success possible in areas that we might not have been able to find on our own. In terms of careers, I feel like this is the battle between programmers and the quality assurance team.</p>
