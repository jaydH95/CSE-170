</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Values</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Veneration of ancestors, community and society connectedness</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Vision</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Make considerable contributions to the 1950 Census Review, as well as bring ourselves closer to Christ and the people of the 1950s.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>SMART Goal:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Working together to review 1000 names in 10 hours as a part of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Involved </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">indexing effort, we plan to further the work of the Lord by helping identify family names in the 1950 Census.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Milestones</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: 1104 names reviewed</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1st session (forming)&nbsp; we will each install the app together, learn the basics about indexing and the blessings of family history, and learn from Nate about how to use the app. (&frac12; hour). </span><b>Complete</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2nd session (storming) we will start together reviewing names for 1 hour. </span><b>Complete</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set up weekly reports based off of the group&rsquo;s progress. </span><b>Complete</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spend 15 minutes a day working on </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Involved</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or as much additional time as we are able. </span><b>Complete</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By our third session (performing), we will have a meeting to review progress and complete any remaining progress. </span><b>Complete</b></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Principles: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project connects to the principle of professionalism. This is because of the nature of family history work- it requires that we remain thoughtful, loyal, connected, and receptive to the nature of our past. By respecting and understanding our foundations, we become better aware of our own purpose in the Plan.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Takeaways:&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Jayd- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first takeaway I had was how much easier it was to accomplish this task with the experience of others. Whenever I couldn&rsquo;t read or format something, someone within the group was able to. My next takeaway was connected to the technology we were using. It took thousands of people to help create this automated program, and we too became a part of that process in helping refine their software.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Mitzi- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn't know how to do indexing, so learning from my classmate and seeing the patience they had to help me, gave me the motivation to do the best I could. I learned that each part of the team was vital because it enabled us to exceed our goals.</span></p>
<p><b>Nate - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was something I had wanted to do before but lacked starting power. This allowed me to jump start into working on this. It was a way that I could contribute to family history, which I have never felt like I was able to do. This really helped me to be able to feel closer to my ancestors.</span></p>
<p><b>Logan- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was told about working on the 1950 census near the start of the semester. I wanted to help with it and was excited for the opportunity. I found it really easy to learn and contribute to the work. Another takeaway was how much easier it became to figure out harder words when we all asked each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Levi-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I really enjoyed reconnecting with the Spirit of Elijah. It had been a while since I had done Family History work because it was something that my missions never focused on much and I hadn&rsquo;t been motivated since I had returned home. It made me realize how easy it is and how far a collective effort can go as far as the Lord&rsquo;s work is concerned.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>SMART Goal:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Work together as a team to defeat the pandemic board game and improve each iteration of the game.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Milestones</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set a time to meet and play</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><b>Complete</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First session will include learning how to play the game (forming).</span> <b>Complete</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play the game with each other in our first session.</span> <b>Complete</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the first session we will talk about and improve our strategies (storming).</span> <b>Complete</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the second session we will come to a conclusion about best strategies and play a perfect final round (performing).</span> <b>Complete</b></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Principles</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The pandemic board game really stressed our understanding of teamwork. All of us had similar intentions as we began the game- We wanted to win. However, we all had different skills and abilities that didn&rsquo;t always work in harmony. Each of our skills was connected to a different strategy to solve the game, but we were also under a time limit with the amount of actions we could perform before our cards ran out. We did not win the first game. We barely won the second, due to a much more communicative and aggressive playing style.</span></p>
<p><b>Takeaways:</b></p>
<p><b>Jayd- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">My biggest takeaway connected to this game is how much we relied on luck to deliver the opportunities we needed to act. I think this mirrors the real life opportunities we come across- they can&rsquo;t always be guaranteed, so we have to use them. The second takeaway was trust. We all had different skills to play the game with, so we had to trust each other to make the best use of our skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Nate - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major takeaway I had was that life deals different hands to different people. Part of why we won the second time was due to luck in our roles and luck of the cards. We will all be in different situations in life and we will all get through life in different ways.</span></p>
<p><b>Logan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">- A big takeaway I had was the consequence of not working to each others strengths. Not doing so lost us the first game. Another take away I had was how taking one problem at a time can help you solve the problem faster than trying to solve all at once.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Mitzi- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">My takeaway about this game was that communication is essential for winning, and getting to know your team can help to understand their strengths and weaknesses. Also, trusting their decisions and giving feedback when necessary is vital.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Levi</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">- This game made me realize the importance of everyone's role in a team. If everyone isn&rsquo;t used effectively in a team then there can be serious consequences, in this case failure and death of the world.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Influence:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Community - Representation</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Values</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bringing an idea and presenting it to a group. Bringing something we enjoy and value and representing it to our community.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Vision: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a fun activity night as a group revolving around learning about one another and the world around us, while also applying skills as researchers and presenters.</span></li>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><b>Milestones:</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet together for the first session and decide the topics which will be presented (forming).</span> <b>Complete</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start researching our topics to present in the first session(storming).</span> <b>Complete</b></li>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Principles: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The principle from this activity that we learned was pressure. We had a limited amount of time to put our presentation together, and then to present with each other. We tended to go between two extremes- not knowing enough to share on the topic, or having access to a ton of information and not knowing where to cut it down. Oftentimes we over-explained to compensate for any lack of clarity, but then created excess. In this project, as in many others, less is more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Takeaways:</b></p>
<p><b>Jayd- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">My biggest takeaway was that I talk too much. It&rsquo;s more effective to understand the main elements of a topic rather than try to explain it in depth from every angle. Precision is key. My next takeaway was the best way to structure presentations. Levi did an excellent job in this, as he demonstrated butterflies as the problem around which his presentation was centered.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Nate - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great takeaway that I had was that it doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of effort to learn something new. It can&rsquo;t hurt, and you learn a lot of different things just in a few minutes or a few hours of time.</span></p>
<p><b>Logan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">- My biggest takeaway from the presentation night was how much different things people knew. Another takeaway was the importance of time management when presenting. That you need to be watching the time carefully when presenting to others.</span></p>
<p><b>Mitzi- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">My takeaway from the presentation was that each team member is different, and getting to know each could help me understand them better. Also, showing genuine interest in the things they like can build friendships and create a better environment at work. In addition to this, I learned that time management when presenting something is essential; interacting with the people around could help get their attention.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Levi</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">- I loved seeing everyone&rsquo;s method of presenting. It made me reflect on the way I could do my own presentations in the future. How do I want to approach my audience? Should I go for the laughs or find the most intriguing examples and ides to really engage them? There are many other examples of ways I could present and this really helped me realize that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Goal 4: The Video Project</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Influence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Group - interaction, Self - Consciousness</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>BYU-Idaho ILO Mission:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Skill Collaborators</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Values:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharing our perspectives of what we have learned in BYUI and our majors, so we can inspire others to come and participate in it. This will require everyone to fulfill their responsibility entirely so the next person can build off of those efforts and eventually create the complete project.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Vision:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">To create a well produced informational video about our individual experiences at university and share it with others, specifically high school aged siblings and other student friends who are curious about the university experience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>SMART Goal</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will all divide the responsibilities into manageable skills. Everyone will tackle a different piece of the video making process and we will come together to create the whole video, which will be shared in our final presentation</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><b>Milestones:</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first session will include brainstorming and an example session (watching example videos and formatting our own video- forming.)</span> <b>Complete</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having location and angles for video.</span> <b>Complete</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the second session, everyone will answer the questions regarding their major and experiences at University.</span> <b>Complete</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finish recording and make any final adjustments. </span><b>Complete</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edit the video together and finish solving any problems or complications as well as sharing it with the designated audiences (performing).</span> <b>Complete</b></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Principles: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project helped us connect both influence and personality. We were selectful in both representing ourselves within the context of our major, as well as representing the other people in our major who have the same goals we do. This project was a nice expression of the connection between these two spheres.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Takeaways:</b></p>
<p><b>Jayd- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">My takeaway was that more people together actually helps create a more concise image of the final product, because in all of our different visions, we share the same threads of the main idea. Another takeaway is that it helps a lot to have input- when we all started proposing ideas, there were some that made a lot more sense than my own.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Nate - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reminded me of my mission. During my mission, we made a lot of videos on social media and it helped me realize that making videos is actually a marketable skill in today&rsquo;s world and I need to remember that.</span></p>
<p><b>Logan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">- With this project I learned the value of using peoples strengths. We all had different skills and we put them together to efficiently make a video. Another thing I learned was the value of being prepared before hand. The proportion we did before filming helped us cut down on the time to make the video.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Mitzi- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">My takeaway from the video is that it is incredible to use your skills to show others something you like. In that way, people may be interested in it because they will feel it is genuine. It was hard for me to speak in front of the camera, but my team helped me do it. And I learned from that that we could help others even in easy ways, which builds trust and confidence in the person and the team.</span></p>
<p><b>Levi</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">- This project really helped me think about my first semester and plan ahead my educational life. I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed this project as well because I got to see others truly put to use some skills that I had never seen from my teammates. I also saw what it takes to present behind a camera (it isn&rsquo;t always as easy as you think).</span></p>
