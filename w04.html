                <H4>1- What did you do to prepare for class this week?</H4>
                <P>This week, I watched the assigned videos and read the case study with Kevin Porter. One of the questions we were given at the beginning of class is, "What personality is he?" However, I am not sure if the sources we have can adequately help us identify a personality. Can't people of different personality types struggle with motivation and finding their purpose?</P>
                <H4>2- What concepts from this week are you uncertain of and would like to know more about?</H4>
                <P>I want to know more about how leadership is implemented in the workspace. Maybe it's my fault for somehow always landing poor quality companies, but a lot of the other students seemed way more satisfied with their employers and experiences than I had been. I'll see if I can go around asking for advice, and also what to look for in a company.</P>
                <H4>3- Where did you put your assignments in Github?</H4>
                <P>My assignments are located in my CSE-170 repository under "w04.index.html".</P>
                <H4>4- Why is this week's topic important?</H4>
                <P>This week's topic was important because we got to learn a strategy to reshape habits. It's super efficient- it only takes 5 seconds!</P>
                <H3>10 Points</H3>
                <H4>5- What is the most significant take away you have gained from your study this week?</H4>
                <P>The most significant takeaway for me was learning about the different certificates available within the credit recommendation. I decided to schedule with an academic advisor so that I can strategically select my classes for the maximum amount of value, instead of just being prompted by the GradPlan recommendations.</P>
                <H4>6- What would you do differently next week?</H4>
                <P>Next week, I think I'll work on my reflection in class. I've been taking notes on concepts that resonate with me, but the reflection questions revolve more around how we can apply and make use of these concepts. If I relate my notes to my reflections, I can better grasp them.</P>
                <H3>20 Points</H3>
                <H4>7- Why is this week's topic important for teamwork?</H4>
                <P>This week's lesson was about how our reactions affect the situation that we're in, and how we can choose our responses regardless of the stimulus that is faced. So even when a team may disagree, they should be able to overcome their differences and react considerately regardless of their former beliefs and experiences.</P>
                <H4>8- How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?</H4>
                <P>I am going to make it a goal to say one nice thing about each of my teammates. I hope this will help motivate them to participate and look forward to coming to class. </P>
                <H4>9- How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had?</H4>
                <P>I have worked in a company before that pretended to be laid back, but was very intense. If standards in one part of the group were not being met, the whole team suffered. In this environment, we were encouraged to refer to our bosses by their first names, but with the way managing worked, it felt super unnatural to me. Their performance expectations and behavior expectations were completely contradictory with each other. I've been hesitant to apply to new jobs based off of this and other experiences within the company. </P>
