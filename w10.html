        <h1>Week 10 Reflection</h1>
        <h2>Jayd Hill, CSE 170</h2>

        <h3>5 Points</h3>
        <h4>1- What did you do to prepare for class?</h4>
        <p>I prepared for class this week by reading the required articles. My team also set up an online planner and have been active on our group chat to make our assigned meeting times. </p>

        <h4>2- What topics were studied this week and what are their definitions?</h4>
        <p>This week's project was about professional communication. Professional communication is when you communicate both ethically, and responsibly within the workplace. This includes keeping the conversations work-oriented, positive, and using communication to build trust.</p>

        <h4>3- What phase of your projects did you complete?</h4>
        <p>We completed the first phase of two of our projects, so at this point, we are 25% of the way through with our Acorn projects.</p>

        <h4>4- Where did you put your assignments in Github?</h4>
        <p>My end of week reflection is located in my CSE 170 repository, and my Acorn Project update is located in Canvas.</p>

        <h3>10 Points</h3>
        <h4>5- What do you do, steps or processes related to this week's topic?</h4>
        <p>Professional communication is a process centered around your goals and focus in the workplace. Everything you communicate is an extension of that underlying goal. For example, someone who is not focused on their work will manifest it in the way they communicate with others, contrary to the actions of those who are committed to their work.</p>

        <h4>6- What is the most significant takeaway you have gained from your study this week?</h4>
        <p>My most significant takeaway from this week was actually within a meme my sister sent me related to my experience working with my team. It says, "Adulting is constantly saying 'I'm not free that day, can you do this date?' Back and forth for 3 months." It would be funny if it didn't hurt.</p>

        <h3>20 Points</h3>
        <h4>7- How does your experience relate to other experiences you've had?</h4>
        <p>This experience of running around trying to find a time that works vaguely reminds me of my high school days, when me and all of my siblings were involved in afterschool clubs, going six different directions at once. Some days, I'm pretty sure I didn't even see my family. I can imagine how stressful that must be as a parent who has to keep track of all of the children and eventually get them together.</p>

        <h4>8- How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?</h4>
        <p>I hope to help out however the opportunity fits. Levi was sick the last time we met, and thankfully I had some cough drops leftover from my last fight with death. That made him pretty happy. So I'll be looking out for more of these moments as they appear. </p>

        <h4>9- If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the Gospel?</h4>
        <p>Professional communication would likely be connected to reverence and ordinances. However, my personal experience with this week's lesson is closer to the parable of the lost sheep. Even if the other 99% of the flock is assembed, we will wait for the remaining one until we can move forward, together. </p>
