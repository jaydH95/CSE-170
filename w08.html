        <h1>Week 07 Reflection</h1>
        <h2>Jayd Hill, CSE 170</h2>

        <h3>5 Points</h3>
        <h4>1- What did you do to prepare for class?</h4>
        <p>This week I was sick for the first day of class, so it changed my work method a little bit. I read all of the required materials and checked for slides when they were posted, and contacted my team for any additional missing information.</p>

        <h4>2- What topics were studied this week and what are their definitions?</h4>
        <p>This week's topic was conflict in the workplace. Normally we define conflict as something that keeps people apart or hinders their progress. However, we also learned that when opposing forces are used correctly, they can act as supports to each other and accomplish the same task. </p>

        <h4>3- What phase of your projects did you complete?</h4>
        <p>This week, we edited the original proposal in our workbook for the final review. Once we have approval, we will begin working on our Acorn Projects.</p>

        <h4>4- Where did you put your assignments in Github?</h4>
        <p>My Reflection this week is located in my CSE-170 repository on Github. Our team proposal will be finalized within the Canvas link.</p>

        <h3>10 Points</h3>
        <h4>5- What do you do, steps or processes related to this week's topic?</h4>
        <p>This week's topic is understood in processes. Conflict isn't usually resolved in a single meeting; rather, it stems from contradicting motivations that are made from many complex aspects. </p>

        <h4>6- What is the most significant takeaway you have gained from your study this week?</h4>
        <p>I really liked the part of the lesson where we represented conflict as a necessity in that specific context. I've been thinking about other forms of conflict as well- is it possible to create a context for these where they work for our gain, rather than detriment? The answer is not an easy yes or no,  but is helping me to think more critically about situations where I view conflict.</p>

        <h3>20 Points</h3>
        <h4>7- How does your experience relate to other experiences you've had?</h4>
        <p>I have a lot of siblings, and growing up with so many in a small space, we fought a lot. Probably more than my parents cared for. Today, however, they're the people I share some of my closest relationships with; I know them very well and love them because of the times where we didn't get along so well. I recognize that not every bad relationship has this potential for growth, but it gives me hope for other areas that don't go so well.</p>

        <h4>8- How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?</h4>
        <p>In the group chat, I am the person who has stepped forward the most so far in terms of organizing meetings and places. I like to know what's going on and check in with everybody, so I think this will be helpful to the team as I keep doing this.</p>

        <h4>9- If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the Gospel?</h4>
        <p>2nd Nephi teaches that in all things, there is a need for opposition. I think this is related to the necessary conflict that we were talking about in our lesson. Just as we grow stronger physically by lifting weights, we can grow stronger spiritually through facing opposition.</p>
