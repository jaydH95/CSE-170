        <h1>Week 14 Reflection</h1>
        <h2>Jayd Hill, CSE 170</h2>

        <h3>5 Points</h3>
        <h4>1- What did you do to prepare for class?</h4>
        <p>I read the chapter on Synergy and watched the final TED Talk about turning strangers into a team. </p>

        <h4>2- What topics were studied this week and what are their definitions?</h4>
        <p>The topic of this final week was Syngergy- this is the process by which many elements come together to create a sum better than all of its pieces. It is the amplifying effect of teamwork. To follow this, we also studied the difference between formal teams and improvised teaming. Formal teams require lots of training where the group is exposed to and gets to know each other. Casual teaming is usually created by the circumstance and its success depends on the adaptability and cohesiveness of its members.  </p>

        <h4>3- What phase of your projects did you complete?</h4>
        <p>The projects and presentation have been completed and are turned in at the discussion board in the proper accessible format. This is like 110% complete, I think. </p>

        <h4>4- Where did you put your assignments in Github?</h4>
        <p>My assignments are located in my CSE-170 repository.</p>

        <h3>10 Points</h3>
        <h4>5- What do you do, steps or processes related to this week's topic?</h4>
        <p>Both creating syngergy and forming good teams are things that are formed very much from processes over time. In the TED Talk, there was a quote by Abraham Lincoln, "I don't like that man very much. I must get to know him better." It can be easy to trust our first impressions without knowing the whole situation, but it is better to devote time to focus on the person outside of what our feelings may be. It takes time to overcome biases and defense mechanisms that don't have a place in every context.</p>

        <h4>6- What is the most significant takeaway you have gained from your study this week?</h4>
        <p>I liked Edmonson's statement on changing our view on others from competition to appreciation- that we should be more focused on enhancing the skills and talents of the people around us than tearing them down. Sometimes I feel really intimidated when someone's skills are progressing faster than my own, but ultimately, they are someone to learn from.</p>

        <h3>20 Points</h3>
        <h4>7- How does your experience relate to other experiences you've had?</h4>
        <p>I've never prioritized teamwork into my academic success before, and it shows in my efforts. The skills I've acquired are good to rely on, but they don't have a far reach. This semester, the majority of my classes had teamwork requirements in one form or another- but I've been able to connect with their goals on a level that goes deeper than a class project. I feel like I've made genuine progress in my own capacity to synergize, and I know that this will be the key from taking my success, academic or otherwise, outside of myself and into other fields. I'm excited to be a part of more teams! </p>

        <h4>8- How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?</h4>
        <p>Our team has officially been disbanded. It was a nice run. I'm really proud we were able to work together. A few of my teammates missed the final class with their certificates, so I have been connecting with them to get those delivered. I will continue to keep in touch with Mitzi throughout her academic and professional career- I hope we can continue to grow well together. </p>

        <h4>9- Why is this week's topic important to teamwork?</h4>
        <p>Teamwork has the word "work" for a reason, it doesn't come without effort. If we really want to enhance our current situation or projects, they can only be improved upon the scale that we invest into them. To do so requires both acceptance and kindness. Once these are mastered, a good team can be formed from anyone. </p>
