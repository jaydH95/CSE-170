        <h1>Week 11 Reflection</h1>
        <h2>Jayd Hill, CSE 170</h2>

        <h3>5 Points</h3>
        <h4>1- What did you do to prepare for class?</h4>
        <p>I prepared for class by reading the assigned materials and coordinating the times to meet with my team for our Acorn Projects. </p>

        <h4>2- What topics were studied this week and what are their definitions?</h4>
        <p>This week's topic was leadership. Leadership is the process of inspiring a team to work together to achieve a certain vision. Sometimes this includes management aspects such as control over time, finances, and resources, but more often this is the level of influence in determining what people work for. </p>

        <h4>3- What phase of your projects did you complete?</h4>
        <p>We are currently 90% finished with the entirety of our Acorn Projects. We completely wrapped up our Get Connected project, our board game, and are more than halfway through with the presentation and video project.</p>

        <h4>4- Where did you put your assignments in Github?</h4>
        <p>My Github assignments are located in my CSE-170 repository.</p>

        <h3>10 Points</h3>
        <h4>5- What do you do, steps or processes related to this week's topic?</h4>
        <p>Leadership is done in processes because of the many skills required to be an effective leader. Leadership includes the process of getting to know a team, and listening and directing them in order to achieve a collective goal. There is no right or wrong way to do any of these, but they have to be worked on together to become effective- more than one thing at a time.</p>

        <h4>6- What is the most significant takeaway you have gained from your study this week?</h4>
        <p>"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us." -Marianne Willamson.</p>
        <p>This quote was very striking to me. I have many goals that I haven't put time toward because I fear failing- but what if I also fear the success? What will I do if I'm successful at them? Looking from this perspective, I am much more motivated to try, if things happen to turn out well. Success or failure, most experiences are worth it.</p>

        <h3>20 Points</h3>
        <h4>7- How does your experience relate to other experiences you've had?</h4>
        <p>I've had several callings and leadership opportunities in the past. At one point, I was a micromanager because that was my limited understanding of a leadership responsibility. I don't have a calling now, but I try to listen and understand others so I can refine my thoughts and opinion before sharing them. I think this is the better way to go about leading. </p>

        <h4>8- How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?</h4>
        <p></p>

        <h4>9- If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the Gospel?</h4>
        <p>Leadership is one of the most essential aspects of the Church, as well as our understanding of how it operates most effectively. Unlike other sects that try to motivate through fear and guilt, we believe that leadership is manifested in love and the desire for others to grow. Through this principle, as we grow closer to God, we can become like God.</p>
