        <h1>Week 06 Reflection</h1>
        <h2>Jayd Hill, CSE 170</h2>
        <h3>5 Points</h3>
        <h4>1- What did you do to prepare for class?</h4>
        <p>To prepare for class, I read all of the preparation materials and watched the Quicksand video. For day two, I finished my definitions and website outline. </p>
        <h4>2- What topics were studied this week and what are their definitions?</h4>
        <p>This week, we finished our User Manuals by defining Health, Work, Play, and Love. Technically speaking, all of these traits are arbitrary and it is up to us how to further define and embody values of professionalism.</p>
        <h4>3- What phase of your projects did you complete?</h4>
        <p>I finished Chapter 2 in my User Manual! I also attached a CSS file to make it a little more readable.</p>
        <h4>4- Where did you put your assignments in Github?</h4>
        <p>My assignments this week are located in my CSE 170 repository.</p>

        <h3>10 Points</h3>
        <h4>5- What do you do, steps or processes related to this week's topic?</h4>
        <p>This week's topic in creating the User Manual was done in steps. It's been a long time since I've made a 5-year plan, and we had specific guidelines and definitions that we had to meet to create it.</p>
        <h4>6- What would you do differently next week?</h4>
        <p>I wish I had shared my life plan with the people who have a little more insight into my life and goals, like my parents and friends. There is still time to show it to them, just outside of the project.</p>
        <h4>7- How does the weekly topic relate to the MIM model?</h4>
        <p>This week's topic relates to the MIM model because we are still examining the first circle, within the self. We are consciously identifying our goals and the conduct it will take to achieve them.</p>
        <h4>8- How would you explain this week's topic to a person not in this class?</h4>
        <p>This week's topic was about examinining our current life plan. We wrote several variations of it with different conditions, yet all of them were connected to our life view. The first one was the current plan, the second one was a backup if the first route was no longer viable, and the last was the plan we'd follow if we had no limits. It's important to think about the last plan because often times we limit our thinking and potential. </p>

        <h3>20 Points</h3>
        <h4>9- How does your experience relate to other experiences you've had?</h4>
        <p>I have a little vision board that I keep in my backpack with me that loosely represents my goals and focus of the year. When I'm able, I also like to make drawings of my future house or potential experiences, but these can be very time consuming to produce. It was actually a lot faster to lay things out in the 5 year plans.</p>
        <h4>10- How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?</h4>
        <p>I got to see a lot of my team's work, but I can't wait to look at the finished project and see their progress as well.</p>

        <h3>Total Points: 100</h3>
