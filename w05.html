    <H1>Week 05 Reflection</H1>
        <H2>Jayd Hill, CSE 170</H2>
        <H3>5 Points</H3>
        <H4>1- What did you do to prepare for class this week?</H4>
            <p>I read all of the source materials about professionalism in the workplace. I contemplated what traits I have that are considered professional, and where I need to put in more work.</p>
        <H4>2- What concepts from this week are you uncertain of and would like to know more about?</H4>
            <p>We discussed how certain parts of the job require a certain dresscode. So I would like to know about when situations call for which dress.</p>
        <H4>3- Where did you put your assignments in Github?</H4>
            <P>My assignments are located in my CSE-170 repository under "w05.index.html".</P>
        <H4>4- Why is this week's topic important?</H4>
            <p>This week's topic was important because we talked about the standards that create a professional workspace. Creating a cohesive environment is what enables the productivity within it.</p>
        <H3>10 Points</H3>
        <H4>5- What is the most significant take away you have gained from your study this week?</H4>
            <p>I think the most important takeaway for me is that there are many ways to be professional. You can excel in politeness, but if you don't maintain dresscode or a clean workspace, you might not be the best person for the job (regardless of skill).</p>
        <H4>6- What do you do, steps or processes related to this week's topic?</H4>
            <P>The process to being professional starts with taking care of yourself, in terms of tidiness, dresscode, and treating yourself with respect. After this is mastered, you can turn this outward and fulfil committments to other people and continue to develop and implement your skills. This is the nature of professional work.</P>
        <H3>20 Points</H3>
        <H4>7- Why is this week's topic important for teamwork?</H4>
            <P>This week's topic is important for teamwork because it showed us how practicing professional qualities can enhance the way the team operates together. People who are dressed similarly, polite, and mindful of their responsibilities and boundaries are much more likely to work together effectively.</P>
        <H4>8- How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?</H4>
            <P>I didn't outright compliment all of my teamates last week, but we did exchange a bit more conversation. I am considering bribing them with snacks.</P>
        <H4>9- How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had?</H4>
            <P>In the fourth grade, my class did an economic simulation called "Ameritown". We learned how to balance checks, write laws, and were even interviewed for professional jobs that we would have for all of one (1) day. I wanted very badly to work in the construction department because they got to build cardboard lunch boxes, and I loved making things. So I dressed up in my most professional outfit, and I got hired as the manager of the construction crew and I had to spend my time doing other things instead of building.</P>
        <H2>Total: 100 Points</H2>
