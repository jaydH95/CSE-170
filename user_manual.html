        <h4>What is my Style?</h4>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>(Green/INFP) I have a mediator personality. I enjoy approaching problems, thinking about the bigger picture, and connecting different types of people. I love alternate perspectives, languages, and solutions.</li>
                <li>I am motivated by experiences that help me grow more into my abilities and skills.</li>
                <li>I favor scenarios where my brain is active and may have trouble in envorionments that value more standard-set procedures that don't require a unique touch to complete.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>What do I value?</h4>
            <ul class=" bullet">
                <li>I value efficiency, functionality, cleanliness, minimalism, peace, and organization.</li>
                <li>I want to spend my time most effectively to create the biggest pay off.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>What do I not have patience for?</h4>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>I understand the importance of needing to find the right candidate for the job, but believe in me before you underestimate me.</li>
                <li>I also value respect and look for it in all interactions. If this fundamental requirement is overlooked, I think critically about people's inner biases and am more reserved in the way I trust.</li>
                <li>I also prefer going through processes myself, rather than watching other people do it. In some cases, learning is better through instruction, but creativity is best through experience. I prefer to think for myself.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>What do people misunderstand about me?</h4>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>I don’t express affection, but I am a very caring person. Your wellbeing means a lot to me. Even if we’re not close or haven’t worked together for long, I like seeing people at peace.</li>
                <li>People often times see me as more extraverted because I have a bold personality. However, when it comes to expressing my preferences in projects and strategies, I can become very shy as I view these as more personal than something to be shared.</li>
                <li>I prefer to think things through with myself before opening up to others. My thinking process is highly introverted.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>How do I prefer people to communicate with me?</h4>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>Start with your main concern or what you are trying to accomplish. This will give me context for the rest of the situation. I am very problem-solving oriented. I collect details, opinions, and resources so that I am properly equipped for any situation.</li>
                <li>If you don’t want a problem solver and would prefer a listening ear, you have to let me know beforehand. I don’t mind listening either, I am just eager to help in any way I can.</li>
                <li>I don’t do a lot of small talk. I think even the smallest actions can carry a lot of meaning, and for this reason, I don't put a lot of time in trivial or fleeting things.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>How do I make decisions?</h4>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>I make decisions very intuitively. I have set rules for myself that I am always in harmony with, and then I make decisions based on how I’m feeling within these guidelines.</li>
                <li>I value the opinion of my coworkers and mentors very highly and consider their input before moving forward.</li>
                <li>After I've decided on something, I follow through without hesitation.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>How can people help me?</h4>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>I prefer it when people are up front with me. I value authenticity and directness.</li>
                <li>Of course criticism can be hard to take, but I believe that it should be shared anyways.</li>
                <li>I respect it when people notice details about my work. </li>
            </ul>
