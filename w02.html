                <H1>Week 02 Reflection</H1>
                <H2>Jayd Hill, CSE 170</H2>
                <H3>5 Points</H3>
                <H4>1- What did you do to prepare for class this week?</H4>
                <P>I read the assigned readings and watched the weekly devotional with my roommates on Sunday. Even though the readings weren’t originally available through the course site, I searched them by author and was able to find the correct ones.</P>
                <H4>2- What concepts from this week are you uncertain of and would like to know more about?</H4>
                <P>Even though I already had Github installed for a previous class, it was very difficult for me to open up a correct repository and format this assignment. (At the time I am writing this, it still isn’t done. It will be my last step.) I would like to learn how to navigate the desktop app more fluently to make this process easier. </P>
                <H4>3- Where did you put your assignments in Github?</H4>
                <P>My assignments are located in my CSE-170 branch under the folder “index.html”.</P>
                <H4>Why is this week's topic important?</H4>
                <P>This week’s topic was important because it allowed us to reflect on our proficiency and comfort levels across the multiple dimensions of influence. Recognizing where we stand allows us to create improvements in the desired direction. </P>
                <H3>10 Points</H3>
                <H4>5- What is the most significant take away you have gained from your study this week?</H4>
                <P>For me, the most significant takeaway was in our reflection survey. I usually dread group projects and because of this I anticipate that I’ll do poorly on them. However, in the survey, we were able to analyze other values and components of groupwork that I value highly. I know with these aspects in mind, I will be able to work with a team effectively. </P>
                <H4>6- What would you do differently next week?</H4>
                <P>Next week I think I should take notes on the preparation material so I can better conceptualize the topic of the week. I’ve been watching a lot of preparation videos for classes, some of which involve similar metaphors or applications. By having a special place reserved for each class, I will be better able to apply the correct concepts. </P>
                <H3>20 Points</H3>
                <H4>7- Why is this week's topic important for teamwork?</H4>
                <P>Influence is essential in teamwork. It is the nature by which we are able to collaborate with each other and improve upon values and ideas. By understanding the spheres of influence and how we connect with them, we are better able to both receive and give influence. </P>
                <H4>8- How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?</H4>
                <P>I think it would be very helpful if I learned about the rest of my teammate’s results in the Multidimensional Influence Assessment so that I can see what my teammates prioritize, and where they excel. We did a quick show of hands while in class, but I think it would have been more beneficial to discuss among ourselves. By knowing their perspectives, I can better meet them at the goal that will eventually be shared across the whole team. </P>
                <H4>9- How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had?</H4>
                <P>Me and my friends have taken personality tests together before. That was even part of the process of me meeting my best friend. While it isn’t proper to categorize humans into simple categories as we are all multidimensional beings, these tests are very useful tools in that they emphasize what shared values and qualities resonate with people. We are then able to build upon these values and establish relationships and achieve a lot together. </P>
