        <h1>Week 13 Reflection</h1>
        <h2>Jayd Hill, CSE 170</h2>

        <h3>5 Points</h3>
        <h4>1- What did you do to prepare for class?</h4>
        <p>This week as we were wrapping things up, I finished my Acorn Project responsibilities and created my portion of the presentation. </p>

        <h4>2- What topics were studied this week and what are their definitions?</h4>
        <p>This week, everyone shared their definitions on discipleship, sound thinking, skilled collaboration, and effective communication. These all meant something different to each person, but we were able to express them in unity through our teamwork efforts as we completed our projects. </p>

        <h4>3- What phase of your projects did you complete?</h4>
        <p>We achieved 100% completion on each of our projects, as well as our presentation. </p>

        <h4>4- Where did you put your assignments in Github?</h4>
        <p>My assignments are located in my CSE-170 repository.</p>

        <h3>10 Points</h3>
        <h4>5- What do you do, steps or processes related to this week's topic?</h4>
        <p>This week's topic concerning presentations was mostly done in steps. We had to make sure all of our material was prepared, that we were coordinated for our delivery, and that we hit all of the correct topics. </p>

        <h4>6- What is the most significant takeaway you have gained from your study this week?</h4>
        <p>I was really touched by the group that cleaned up the nature walk for their Discipleship ILO. It hadn't even occurred to me that we could do something like that. It probably wouldn't have worked for my team anyways due to our schedule coordination, but I'll keep it in mind for future projects. </p>

        <h3>20 Points</h3>
        <h4>7- How does your experience relate to other experiences you've had?</h4>
        <p>With all of the presentations, I almost felt like I was at a class fair in terms of seeing everyone's different projects. The best ones were the ones where the students expressed enjoyment working together, you could see how much fun they had and what they were able to accomplish. I think I'll organize D&D nights for my family home evening when I move back after this semester. </p>

        <h4>8- How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?</h4>
        <p>In addition to completing my tasks, I also organized our final document that we will share our progress and experiences on. Additionally, I will deliver the awards to Levi and Logan who were not with us at the time of the final presentations. </p>

        <h4>9- Why is this week's topic important to teamwork?</h4>
        <p>This week's topic was especially important because we were able to see the big picture implications of teamwork and the time we spent together. This was the final project where we get to see our talents multiplied and efforts revealed. I think we did a pretty good job. </p>
